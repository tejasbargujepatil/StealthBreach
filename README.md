### üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to **StealthBreach**, a comprehensive script designed for educational and ethical hacking purposes. This script facilitates the creation of a hidden backdoor user on Windows systems, demonstrating how security features can be bypassed and vulnerabilities exploited. **StealthBreach** is crafted to provide insights into system security, helping users understand potential threats and the importance of safeguarding their systems.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
**WARNING:** This script is strictly for educational use only. It is imperative to utilize this script only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical, and could lead to severe legal consequences.

## üìñ Overview
The **StealthBreach** script performs the following critical actions:
1. **Creates a hidden backdoor user** with administrative privileges, allowing persistent access.
2. **Disables Windows Defender** and other security features, reducing the system's defenses.
3. **Opens Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** and SSH ports for remote access from a specified public IP address.
4. **Clears system logs** to erase evidence of malicious actions, complicating detection efforts.
5. **Exfiltrates sensitive files** to a specified remote server (placeholder for educational demonstration).
6. **Disables system restore** and deletes shadow copies, making recovery difficult.
7. **Encrypts user files** in the Documents folder and generates a ransom note, simulating ransomware behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before using the **StealthBreach** script, ensure you have the following:
- A **Windows Virtual Machine (VM)** with administrative privileges for safe testing.
- A **Public IP address** for remote access, customizable within the script.
- Basic knowledge of **batch scripting** and the **Windows command line** for effective use and modification of the script.

To get started, clone this repository or download the script directly:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tejasbargujepatil/StealthBreach.git
```

### **2. Modify the Script**
Open the script in a text editor and customize the following lines as needed:
- **Exfiltration Section:** Update the remote server URL for sensitive file transfer.
- **Firewall Rules:** Ensure the public IP address is correctly set for firewall configurations.

### **3. Run the Script**
Follow these steps to execute the script:
1. Open **Command Prompt** as **Administrator**.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\StealthBreach
   ```
3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   StealthBreach.bat
   ```

### **4. Set Up Remote Access**
To facilitate remote access:
- Configure **port forwarding** on your router to allow RDP and SSH connections.
- Refer to additional instructions in the script for verifying RDP and SSH settings.

### **5. Connect Remotely**
Utilize Remote Desktop Connection or an SSH client to connect to your VM using the public IP and the credentials specified in the script.

## üîí Security Considerations
- **Change Default Passwords:** Always change default passwords immediately after testing to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Disable or Delete Backdoor User:** Remove the backdoor user account when no longer needed to enhance security.
- **Review System Security Settings:** Regularly assess your system's security configurations and user accounts.

---

## ü§ù Ethical Considerations
- **Permission is Key:** Only perform these actions on systems you own or have explicit permission to access.
- **Legal Awareness:** Understand the legal implications and responsibilities associated with unauthorized access.
